# VideoAnalysis
This project aims to provide a chrome extension and an API for the filtration of youtube videos on 3 key elements: hate, NSFW, and profanity. Through this, we seek to provide a stronger interface for users to be able to pre-filter the content they choose to consume. \
This project awarded at PantherHack '23.
